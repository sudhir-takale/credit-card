# Problem Statement

## Unusual Spends

You work at a credit card company and as a value-add they want to start providing alerts to users when their spending in
any particular category is higher than usual.

- Compare the total amount paid for the current month, grouped by category with the previous month
- Filter down to the categories for which the user spent at least 50% more this month than last month
- Compose an e-mail message to the user that lists the categories for which spending was unusually high

Sample Email -

Thanks,
